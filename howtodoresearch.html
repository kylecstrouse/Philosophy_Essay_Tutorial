                        <p>Now that you are familiar with the basics of logic, we can learn how to conduct philosophical research. Reading and analyzing the works of others will help challenge your preexsting conceptual model, strengthen your logical skills, and prepare you for writing.</p>

                        <h3 class="blue">Narrowing Down Your Field</h3>

                        <p>The vastness of philosophy can be daunting. That's why it's a good idea to narrow down the field you will be investigating before starting to research. Ask yourself; is my question ethical? Or metaphysical? Once you've narrowed down the field, you'll be able to pinpoint exactly what kind of context is necessary in order to tackle the question.</p>

                        <h3 class="blue">Reading Introductory Texts</h3>

                        <p>Once you've figured out what field you'll be focusing on, I highly reccomend picking up an introductory text on the topic. A good introductory text will provide a birds-eye-view of the field you are studying, familiarize you with its technical terms, and prepare you for research into primary sources. A list of good introductory books will be linked at the end of this section.</p>

                        <h3 class="blue">Primary Sources</h3>

                        <p>After reading an introductory book, you should be ready to tackle some primary sources. Primary sources are texts from actual philosophers, where they put forward their arguments, challenge arguments from others, or respond to criticism. Reading these texts can be challenging for a beginner, so I've outlined some guidelines below.</p>

                        <h2 class="blue">2. How to Read a Work of Philosophy</h2>

                        <h3 class="blue">Take it slow</h3>

                        <p>Some beginners have a tendency to read philosophical texts like a novel, where little pausing is done until the end of a chapter or section. This is not an effective way to read philosophy. Think of a philosophical text as a work of mathematics or scince--if you do not understand the concepts at the beginning of the chapter, you won't be able to understand them at the end. Take your time moving through a work; you may have to read a page 3 or 4 times before you understand it.</p>

                        <h3 class="blue">Identiy and Address Confusion</h3>

                        <p>If you get confused, it is likely because you failed to completely understand a definition along the way. Don't move on in the hopes that you will understand after you read more--this will only perpetuate you confusion. Instead, move back to the last point in the chapter or section that you completely understand, and work very slowly from there. If you read something that confuses you, search online to try and find out what the author is trying to communicate. It's likely someone else has encountered the same source of confusion before you.</p>

                        <h3 class="blue">Take Careful Notes</h3>

                        <p>Notes help solidy and retain information. Good notes can also act as a supplement to the chapter, allowing you to skim the material without actually having to reread. It's a good idea to jot down any definitions that seem important (definitions are the cornerstone of philosophy!). You can also write down your own opinions on the author's arguments, which will provide material when you propose your own arguments.</p>

                        <h3 class="blue">Reconstruct the Author's Arguments</h3>

                        <p>Perhaps the most effective way to understand and remember an author's argument is to reconstruct it yourself. After reading a chapter, try to identiy the main point that the author was arguing for. What were the premises that they used to back up their conclusion? Were they sound? What logical steps did the author take to get from the premises to the conclusion? Were they valid steps? Answering these questions will provdie you with a deep familiarty of the material.</p>

                        <p>The following resources are good places to start when doing research. Keep your philosophical question in mind before diving in!</p>

                        <h3 class="blue">Introductury Texts</h3>

                        <p>Below are good introductions to each field of philosophy:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Metaphysics--<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metaphysics-Contemporary-Introduction-Introductions-Philosophy/dp/0415401348" target="_blank"><em>Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction--3rd Edition</em></a> by Michael J. Loux</li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="blue">Primary Sources</h3>

                        <p>These are some primary sources that I would reccomend to beginners. They are not field-specific--you can find those in the introductions above--but if you are just interested in getting your hands dirty with some real philosophy, these are good places to start.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dialogues-Plato-Enriched-Classics/dp/1439169489" target="_blank"><em>The Dialogues of Plato</em></a> by Plato. I reccomend the version above for its context, but a free version can be found <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plato/index.htm" target="_blank">here</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5827/5827-h/5827-h.htm" target="_blank"><em>The Problems of Philosophy</em></a> by Betrand Russell. This is an introduction of sorts, but an opinonated one written by one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. Somewhat technical.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/descartes/1639/meditations.htm" target="_blank"><em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em></a> by Rene Descartes. An approachable and highly influential piece of philosophy.</li>
                            <li ><a href="https://www.utilitarianism.com/mill1.htm" target="_blank"><em>Utilitarianism</em></a> by John Stuart Mill. A foundational text in ethics.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <section class="main-section">
                        
                        <h2 class="challenge-head">Challenge</h2>
                          
                            <p>Before moving on to the final section, do some research! Try to read one introductory text before attempting to write--it will give you ideas to write about, and oppurtunites to test your analytical skills.</p>
