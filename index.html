                        Philosophy is the study of questions. More specifically, philosophy is the study of <em>fundamental</em> questions. “What is a right action?” “What is the world made out of?” and “Why is there something rather than nothing?” are all typical examples of these fundamental questions. But not all philosophy is concerned with fundamental questions. If you have ever asked yourself a question that you didn’t know the answer to, and thought about the answer to that question, then you did philosophy. That is because philosophy is an <em>interdisciplinary</em> study. In fact, it is the foundation for almost <em>all</em> forms of study, from physics and organic chemistry to art and anthropology.

                        Broken down into its Greek roots, philosophy translates to “the love of wisdom” (from Greek ‘philo’ for love and ‘sophia’ for wisdom) Unsurprisingly, in order to do philosophy well you have to really <em>want</em> to know the answer to the question you’re studying. Although philosophers deal with what are typically called ‘basic’ questions, providing answers to these questions can become very complicated very quickly. In this tutorial you will learn how to ask good philosophical questions, and how to create persuasive answers to those questions in essay form.

                    <p>Before we start digging into philosophy, it's a good idea to have some materials ready to go. I reccomend having open on your computer:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some kind of note-taking software (paper and pencil are also fine)</li>
                        <li>The <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> open in another tab</li>
                        <li>A good <a href="https://youtu.be/V7IUtUsfARA" target="_blank">classical music playlist</a>(so you feel like a true philosopher)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Also, at the end some sections you will find a challenge to help test your newly acquired philosophical skills. I reccomend you take some time to complete each one before moving on to the next section. Have fun!</p>
