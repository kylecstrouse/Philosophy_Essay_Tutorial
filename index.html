                        Philosophy is the study of questions. More specifically, philosophy is the study of <em>fundamental</em> questions. “What is a right action?” “What is the world made out of?” and “Why is there something rather than nothing?” are all typical examples of these fundamental questions. But not all philosophy is concerned with fundamental questions. If you have ever asked yourself a question that you didn’t know the answer to, and thought about the answer to that question, then you did philosophy. That is because philosophy is an <em>interdisciplinary</em> study. In fact, it is the foundation for almost <em>all</em> forms of study, from physics and organic chemistry to art and anthropology.

                        We can understand why so many disciplines have philosophy at their core by asking questions. For instance, most people are familiar with some basic doctrines of modern day linguistics—that there are certain types of words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) that all languages contain. Now, let’s ask a question; what is a noun? You might respond that it is a person, place, or thing (as most American middle school children are taught). “Okay,” a philosopher might respond, “but what is a thing?” And so you might point towards a baseball, or a fire hydrant. “What makes a baseball or a fire hydrant a thing?” the philosopher asks. Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that you say a baseball and a fire-hydrant are a “thing” because they exist physically in space and time (the technical term for this kind of existence is “corporeal”). “So by that definition,” the Philosopher responds, “’Shakespeare’ must not be a noun, or ‘Santa Claus’, since nothing called ‘Shakespeare’ or ‘Santa Claus’ currently exists in space and time.” If you believe that the words ‘Shakespeare’ and ‘Santa Claus’ are nouns, then we must once again investigate the question “What is a noun?”

                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
